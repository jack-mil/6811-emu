# 6811 Emulator #

A brief experiment to learn the Rust language, as well as Test Driven Development.
Only a few opcodes are implemented, and no user interface exists. The software exists as a library and test cases executed using `cargo test`

Unfortunately largely abandoned now, but I would love to learn more Rust details at some point.

Only these opcodes have been implemented.

- [x] LDAA (DIR, IMM)
- [x] ADDA (DIR, IMM)
